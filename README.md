This project works to implement a basic Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) model using PyMc in order to analyza a data set of responses about plant knowledge in binary form. The model assumes that each informants latent competence value (D) drawn from a Uniform(0.5,1) distribution and that each item has a latent consensus answer (Z) with a Bernoulli(0.5) prior. The likelihood of each response is calculated based on whether the informant agrees with the populations consensus, weighted by their competence.

Sampling was confuscted using PyMC with 4 chains, 2000 draws per chain, and 1000 tuning steps. All R-Hat values were exactly 1, and sample sizes were high for all parameters. Posterior means for informant competence (D) ranged from 0.56 to 0.87. Informant 5 had the highest estimated competence (0.87) while Informant 2 had the lowest (0.56). This indicates the variation in each informants responses aligned with the inferred consensus. Consensus answers (Z) were estimated by rounding the posterior mean probabilities for each item. The resulting consensus key matched majority vote for 15 out of 20 items, 75% agreement. Differences occured such where the majority vote reflected influence from lower-competence informants, which the model down-weights. The prior for competence was Uniform(0.5,1.0) and the prior for consensus answers was Bernoulli(0.5).
